# firstGameProjectPython
tutorials are ok, but I want to start doing my own thing a bit.

Trying an idea for some kind of adventure game.
Possibly working on strategy for a tycoon game later.
My first upload is an hour of just playing with stuff
fixing what's broken and adding more features.
Already learnt a lot about things I need to do.
will think about adding OOP and functions as it gets more complex.
